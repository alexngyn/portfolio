Vex is a robotics competion where robots compete 2v2 to complete a objective such as shooting a disk into a goal in order to get points.
I joined quite late in the season, starting in December instead of April however was able to learn quickly. 

# Nationals 

Even though I did not have a very good robot, my robot was very good at defence as I was the only one to use 6 motors for my drivetrain (limit of 8) so I could push other robots easily. I made a allience with a good offencive robot and we got to semi finals. However the critera for worlds also conciders docuemnataion, notebook, and intervew which I won overall. 

# Virtual Skills

There is also a virtual competion where we have to try to get the highest points possible in a minute using a virtual robot, I coded the robot to get the theoretical maximum score tieing 1st with 4 people.

# Worlds

after nationals we first added a shooter
the we added expansion, a indexer, and skirts.

World was quite bad because we got stuck on disks multiple times, expansion got stuck multiple time, and indexer broke multiple times, drivetrain also broke many times.

# Reflection

After this I learnt to test alot before the competion and to use various methods to ensure reliabilty
I would also use stronger materials such as polycarbonate instead of abs and do stress simulations to test if it will break (talked about in cad with vex)
Lastly I learnt about using loctite and nylock to make sure a screw will never come loose

## Projectile Motion

We added a file projectile_motion.ipynb to this repository since we need it for the calculation of our disk path. But you can have a look at it in a [copy in Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZDqA7VL2sX8HjGgLV1grBOFcIxxB_T2S?usp=sharing) too.

## Version 1 (Nationals)

This robot was used to compete in nationals, it used six motors to go fast but I relized the gear ratios was decreasing the speed.

## Version 2 (Skills)

This is the rebuild right before a skills challenge, the code was quite bad and the shooter was not working.

## Version 3 (Shooter V1)
the photo is somewhere

We rebuilt it with more structural rigidity, added a intake, and a shooter.
## Version 4 (Worlds)

To be built.

This is our final iteration, we are going to add expansion, a indexer, and skirts.

World was quite bad because we got stuck on the disk multiple times, expansion got stuck multiple time, and indexer broke multiple times.

## Version 4 (City)

We got 2nd last plave

# Virtual Programming Skills

## Attempt 1:

<img src="https://github.com/alexngyn/VRC-SPIN-UP/Documentation/Code/72.png?raw=true" width="400" alt="67 Points"></img>

67 points, not bad for a first try. Preload of 2 and starting position of E. I could just repeat what I'm doing untill the timer is done but the code currently is massively long and inefficent.

## Atempt 2

So I did what I said I wouldn't do. I just repeated what I did in Attempt 1. Good score though. 207.

## Attempt 3:

<img src="https://github.com/alexngyn/VRC-SPIN-UP/Documentation/Code/322.png?raw=true" width="400" alt="322 Points"></img>

I got a bit carried away, I found out that one of the ways the save time is by barely picking a disc up while using gps to allow for more consistency.

# Summary:

We didn't do so well although learnt a lot this season. most important thing i learnt is use loctite. next year i will be joining [1599V](https://github.com/flooof/1599V-VRC) and lets hope i do better.
