Vex is a robotics competion where robots compete 2v2 to complete a objective such as shooting a disk into a goal in order to get points.
I joined quite late in the season, starting in December instead of April however was able to learn quickly. 

# Nationals 

Even though I did not have a very good robot, my robot was very good at defence as I was the only one to use 6 motors for my drivetrain (limit of 8) so I could push other robots easily. I made a allience with a good offencive robot and we got to semi finals. However the critera for worlds also conciders docuemnataion, notebook, and intervew which I won overall. 

# Virtual Skills

There is also a virtual competion where we have to try to get the highest points possible in a minute using a virtual robot, I coded the robot to get the theoretical maximum score tieing 1st with 4 people.

# Worlds

after nationals we first added a shooter
the we added expansion, a indexer, and skirts.

World was quite bad because we got stuck on disks multiple times, expansion got stuck multiple time, and indexer broke multiple times, drivetrain also broke many times.

# Reflection

After this I learnt to test alot before the competion and to use various methods to ensure reliabilty
I would also use stronger materials such as polycarbonate instead of abs and do stress simulations to test if it will break (talked about in cad with vex)
Lastly I learnt about using loctite and nylock to make sure a screw will never come loose
