FRC is similar to the VEX robotics competion but bigger and they allow custom parts. A old coach at my school started a frc team however COVID occured which reduced progress significntly until it was forgoten about. In may 2023, after I came back from vex worlds, me and the new coach decided to restart this project. We relubicated the drivetrain, switched it from two to 4 motor drive for speed, and then got the drivetrain to work. In may, the school had a event themed RESET which is named after COVID and we thought showcasing out robot would be apporpriate. We then built a simple frame to support a armchair and then attached a 2.4GHz pwm reciver and allowed people to ride it during the exibitian. https://github.com/flooof/reactivate23
