I'm a endurance athlete and I my goal is to complete an Half-Ironman before I graduate High School and a Full Ironman before I finish College.

# **Cross Country** 

Every Fall and Winter since 2021, I train 1hr each morning 3 times a week. 
Our season final for 2024 was a 5k race and a 15k relay on an muddy trail in KL against several other very competitive international schools.

# **Endurance Running**

In 2023, my friend convinced me to sign up for the 2024 HCMC half marathon. We trained together several times a week, doing short, long and interval workouts. I completed the half marathon in 3:02.

In 2024, after training for cross country very intensely, I decided to do the 2025 HCMC half marathon with minimal traing. Completed in 2:08, very good improvement compared to previous year.

# **Endurance Cycling** 

In 2025, a different friend convinced me to buy a bike to join their group rides as I can improve my VO2 max. I decided why not and I've been on multiple rides with them across southern vietnam, the longest being 120k to Vung Tau.

# **Swimming**

I was on the swim team in 2021 but decided to leave as it conflicted with my cross country schedule
I kept training with a coach every weekend 
In 2025, I joined the swim team again to prepare me for my first Triathlon

# **Triathlon**

Now that I was practicing all the sports I told my self, why not do a Triathlon. I convinced anouther friend to go to a Olympic Distance race with me in Bau Trang in march of 2025 and I finished in 3:40, which was a bit over my goal time. There aren't that many triathlons near me, as both half-ironmans in vietnam require flying there. One I found near me was in August but I had to either do a Spinrt distace or a 70.3, one being to short and one being too long for me. I decided to do the relay for the 70.3 with a couple friends. I made two teams of 3 each which gives us encouragemant of wanting to beat the other team. I was doing the swim.
