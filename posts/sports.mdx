I'm a endurance athlete and I hope to complete an Ironman sometime before college.

# Cross Country 

Every Fall and Winter since 2021, I train 1hr each morning 3 times a week. 
Our season final for 2024 was a race on an muddy trail in KL against several other very competitive international schools.

# Endurance Running

In 2023, my friend convinced me to sign up for the 2024 HCMC half marathon. We trained together several times a week, doing short, long and interval workouts. I completed the half marathon in 3:02.

In 2024, after training for cross country very intensely, I decided to do the 2025 HCMC half marathon with minimal traing. Completed in 2:08, very good improvement compared to previous year.

# Endurance Cycling 

In 2025, a diffrent friend convinced me to buy a bike to join their group rides as I can improve my VO2 max. I decided why not and I've been on multiple rides with them across southern vietnam, the longest being 120k to Vung Tau.

# Swimming

I was on the swim team in 2021 but decided to leave as it conflicted with my cross country schedule
I kept traning with a coach every weekend 
In 2025, I joined the swim team again to train competiively

# Triathlon

Now that I was practicing all the sports I told my self, why not do a Triathlon.
I convinced anouther friend to go to a Olympic Distance race with me in Bau Trang
