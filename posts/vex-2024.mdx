Nov 11 Scrimage at SSIS

We did not do well because the low bot design restricts a good catapult and also we had to do a two motor catapult and did not have a effective pnumatic intake either. Cool RGB thou.

Dec 1-2 Formosa at TAS (Taipei)

We did okay, 18th out of 32. better than expected

Dec 14 Scrimage at Fullbright

The ref did not read the rule book (SF 2-2 we should have won). 

Jan 20 North Nationals (Hanoi)

going to a abroad event with 50 robotics kids is so fun
event was quite rigged, the host let their own teams break the rules but not us, they also switched the event start time from 8am to 7 am and told us a 11pm
oh btw, the host's team won the world's spot and they said "we have to go to usa again [groan]"
they spelt my judges award (best interview) wrong :(

Feb 7 South Nationals at SSIS

In the morning we had a big issue, our batteries were broken and somtimes would cut out, we asked around but could not borrow any so were forced to play with the broken batteries. Our robot turned off mid match for all of our morning matches making us lose all. In the afternoon we won all our matches because we were able to ask anouther school and then we won finals too. Unfororanatly the requirement for the worlds qualification has a minimum amount of wins that day so we did not get it. We were the only team with a score of 25/25 on our documentaion and interview so we got the design award and I think that everyone including the other teams think we deserve the qualification but we didnt get it :(
