### Competitions

## Nov 11 Scrimage at SSISs

We did not do well because the low bot design restricts a good catapult and also we had to do a two motor catapult and did not have a effective pnumatic intake either. Cool RGB thou.

## Dec 1-2 Formosa at TAS (Taipei)

We did okay, 18th out of 32. better than expected. main issue was that we needed more pactice

## Dec 14 Scrimage at Fullbright

The ref did not read the rule book (SF 2-2 we should have won). 

## Jan 20 North Nationals (Hanoi)

going to a abroad event with 50 robotics kids is so fun
event was quite rigged, the host let their own teams break the rules but not us, they also switched the event start time from 8am to 7 am and told us a 11pm
oh btw, the host's team won the world's spot and they said "we have to go to usa again [groan]"
they spelt my judges award (best interview) wrong :(

## Feb 7 South Nationals at SSIS

In the morning we had a big issue, our batteries were broken and somtimes would cut out, we asked around but could not borrow any so were forced to play with the broken batteries. Our robot turned off mid match for all of our morning matches making us lose all. In the afternoon we won all our matches because we were able to ask anouther school and then we won finals too. Unfororanatly the requirement for the worlds qualification has a minimum amount of wins that day so we did not get it. We were the only team with a score of 25/25 on our documentaion and interview so we got the design award and I think that everyone including the other teams think we deserve the qualification but we didnt get it :(

### Computer-Aided Design 


Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a online method of planning out the robot, by creating 3D models, they can visualize how different parts fit together and ensure proper functionality. 

## initial

I learnt Cad for VEX during the winter break of 2022. I used Autodesk Inventor as it has lots of documentation for how to use vex parts with it. I was able to make many basic cads that helped me and i learnt alot of new things along the way.

## advanced rendering

during the fall of 2023, i started to look into more advanced rendering teqniques, mainly for media. I learnt about lighting, angles, and other techniques.

## poster

in jan we did a render with our new block to show the height of it, we then printed as a poster, a challenge we had was pixelation as the poster was very big so we did this render in 20k.

## simulation

In feb we wanted a big piece of polycarbonate to act as a sled to go over a obsticale and we did many simulations in order to calculate how many layers we needed and what shapes were most oplimal.

### Code

At the end of the season, we post our code publicly such that other teams can take inspiration and learn from us.

# 2024

<img src="https://github.com/vex-ssis/2024/blob/main/assets/OverUnder.png?raw=true" align="right" width="40%"></img>

SSIS Robotics in [this years](https://github.com/vex-ssis/2024) "Over Under" VEX competition 2023-2024. Big changes for Vietnam! The total number of teams representing Vietnam at VEX worlds has doubled - now **3 teams** from HS can represent Vietnam, and still one team at MS. The general team number for SSIS changed from 76209 to 1599.

## Scrimmage at SSIS 2023/11/11

Four teams signed up to participate at [this November event](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-23-4368.html#general-info). But way more teams showed up in the auditorium at SSIS. We had to hack the system a little, and with so many changes no results were published.

## Vietnam VRC Tournament 2023 at Fulbright University 2023/12/17

After another tournament in Hanoi this was a big event organized by [STEAM for Vietnam](https://steamforvietnam.org/) and **15 teams** showed up [to this event](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-23-4188.html). 

Results with W-L-T for SSIS 1599:

- #2 1599R 7-1-0 SSIS Dragons Christopher Columbus

## Vietnam VEX Robotics National Championship 2024 - VRC Blended Event 2024/01/21

The [first qualifying event](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-23-4992.html#general-info) of the season. But only team 36070M from team **11** qualified by winning the Excellence Award. At least [team 1599V](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/V5RC/1599V) (not Vector but Vietnamese Banana Farmers) got the Judges Award. **33 teams** met in Hanoi!
