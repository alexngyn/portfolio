We saw that we did not have enough time in the prepious year for driver prarctice which was the main reason we were not able to win early events, so we decided to start the season early. In april, we met to watch the finals of the previous season and then watch the new game reveal. we then started analyzing the game given what we had and then build a robot, however, the official rules were not out yet so we analyzed it based on speculation. We chose a forklift on a four bar as this is a very simple design that can be built quickly,the problem with this design is it isnt very accurate, also, we designed the forklift to hold up to 8 rings but the rules onluy allow a possesion limit of 2. the robot could also not move around the mobile goals. During summer we did a porper game analyis then listing all possible options. We ended up choosing a roller intake because this does not need much accuracy on the driver's part and have it on a four bar to climb.
VEX Formosa Dec 6-7 - 32 Teams, got to Semifinals.
We could not bring our main driver because he could not get a visa, so I was the replacement driver. We did well on our first day, winning all our matches except one (because of field issues) and placed 4th place, our second day we did less well and dropped our position down to 10th, we got into alliance selection as 4th seed. Our quarter finals were all 4 teams from my school against each other where my alliance won, in semi finals we won but my teammate made the mistake of accidentally touching a protected goal and got us DQed. Other than the matches, we were able to connect with many teams such as from Manila, Taiwan, and Indonesia and learnt new ideas. Something funny was that JIS was across the hall in our hotel and we went to each other’s rooms.

VEX Qualifers - Nov 16 - 36 Teams, Got to finals. Qualified to nationals 60 teams- 3 slots to nationals. As a school. Feb 2025 HCMC- end FEB Hanoi- World- May (same time as AP)

## Available spots at Worlds

That's even more the case for 2025 and the available spots to compete at VEX Worlds in Dallas. Now there are [7 spots at V5RC](https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/articles/5474199602071-Qualifying-Criteria-for-VEX-Robotics-Competition-Events) for Vietnam!
