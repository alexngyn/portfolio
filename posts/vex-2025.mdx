The Scrimmage had more than 30 teams compete and learn at this scrimmage! All teams shared their knowledge and the students, organizers and supporters embraced this spirit.

Here is a [short article](https://www.ssis.edu.vn/student-life/post-details/~board/hs/post/ssis-hosts-vietnams-first-vex-robotics-scrimmage-of-the-year) of this event on the website of SSIS.

Our team won 3/4 matches and were Quarter Finalists.

### SSIS Qualifiers

The SSIS VEX Qualifers had 37 showed up. Team V won 6/10 matches and were Finalists
  
### Taipei Formosa

We could not bring our main driver because he could not get a visa, so I was the replacement driver. We did well on our first day, winning all our matches except one (because of field issues) and placed 4th place, our second day we did less well and dropped our position down to 10th, we got into alliance selection as 4th seed. Our quarter finals were all 4 teams from my school against each other where my alliance won, in semi finals we won but my teammate made the mistake of accidentally touching a protected goal and got us DQed. Other than the matches, we were able to connect with many teams such as from Manila, Taiwan, and Indonesia and learnt new ideas.
