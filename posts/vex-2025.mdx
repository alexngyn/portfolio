All teams shared their knowledge and the students, organizers and supporters embraced this spirit.

Here is a [short article](https://www.ssis.edu.vn/student-life/post-details/~board/hs/post/ssis-hosts-vietnams-first-vex-robotics-scrimmage-of-the-year) of this event on the website of SSIS.

Labeled as [SSIS VEX Qualifying Tournament Season 24-25](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-V5RC-24-7852.html#general-info) it were not only SSIS teams on this November weekend - 37 showed up, and Panda robotics coming out as Tournament Champions.

Highest place is [#4 for 1599V in skills](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-V5RC-24-7852.html#results-) and [#2 for 1599R SSIS Christopher Columbus](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-V5RC-24-7852.html#results-) with 6-0-0 a total of 6 wins!

32 Teams, got to Semifinals.
We could not bring our main driver because he could not get a visa, so I was the replacement driver. We did well on our first day, winning all our matches except one (because of field issues) and placed 4th place, our second day we did less well and dropped our position down to 10th, we got into alliance selection as 4th seed. Our quarter finals were all 4 teams from my school against each other where my alliance won, in semi finals we won but my teammate made the mistake of accidentally touching a protected goal and got us DQed. Other than the matches, we were able to connect with many teams such as from Manila, Taiwan, and Indonesia and learnt new ideas. Something funny was that JIS was across the hall in our hotel and we went to each otherâ€™s rooms.

- Formosa (Taipei): 9-3 WL | Semi Finalists & Amaze Award
