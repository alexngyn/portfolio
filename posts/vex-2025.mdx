> VEX Robotics is a global competition where teams design, build and program robots to compete in team-based engineering challenges. Each season features a new game that tests strategy, innovation, and collaboration, encouraging creativity and real-world problem-solving through STEM.

            This season's challenge is called Over Under, which is played on a 12’x12’ square field. Two Alliances of two compete in matches consisting of a Autonomous Period, followed by Driver Controlled Period. The objective of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by Scoring Rings on Stakes, Placing Mobile Goals, and by Climbing at the end of the Match.

The Scrimmage had more than 30 teams compete and learn at this scrimmage! All teams shared their knowledge and the students, organizers and supporters embraced this spirit.

Here is a [short article](https://www.ssis.edu.vn/student-life/post-details/~board/hs/post/ssis-hosts-vietnams-first-vex-robotics-scrimmage-of-the-year) of this event on the website of SSIS.

### SSIS Qualifiers

6-4 WL | Finalists

The SSIS VEX Qualifers had 37 showed up. Team V did good enough to qualify to nationals.
  
### Taipei Formosa

9-3 WL | Semi Finalists ＆ Amaze Award  

We could not bring our main driver because he could not get a visa, so I was the replacement driver. We did well on our first day, winning all our matches except one (because of field issues) and placed 4th place, our second day we did less well and dropped our position down to 10th, we got into alliance selection as 4th seed. Our quarter finals were all 4 teams from my school against each other where my alliance won, in semi finals we won but my teammate made the mistake of accidentally touching a protected goal and got us DQed. Other than the matches, we were able to connect with many teams such as from Manila, Taiwan, and Indonesia and learnt new ideas.

7-2 WL | Quarter Finalists ＆ 1st Seed ＆ Innovate Award  

Nationals, with 27 teams attending, I went alone as my team were busy with other competitions. We did very well, winning 7/7 of my matches the first day. 

## Code

Throughout the year, we learnt and tested new motion control algorithms such as PID controller, Pure Pursuit, and Odometry.

At the end of the season, we post our code publicly such that other teams can take inspiration and learn from us: [Code Base](https://github.com/alexngyn/1599V-VRC-HIGH-STAKES)

https://github.com/alexngyn/1599V-VRC-HIGH-STAKES

## Documentation

We also document our build throughout the year which is one of the criteria of the Excellence Award. We write it on paper and [here](https://1599v.netlify.app/2025) is a scan of our notebook.
