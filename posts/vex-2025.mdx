We saw that we did not have enough time in the prepious year for driver prarctice which was the main reason we were not able to win early events, so we decided to start the season early. In april, we met to watch the finals of the previous season and then watch the new game reveal. we then started analyzing the game given what we had and then build a robot, however, the official rules were not out yet so we analyzed it based on speculation. We chose a forklift on a four bar as this is a very simple design that can be built quickly,the problem with this design is it isn't very accurate, also, we designed the forklift to hold up to 8 rings but the rules onluy allow a possesion limit of 2. the robot could also not move around the mobile goals. During summer we did a porper game analyis then listing all possible options. We ended up choosing a roller intake because this does not need much accuracy on the driver's part and have it on a four bar to climb.
