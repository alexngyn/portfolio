Made a fiberglass box using composite molds.
I designed and made a 3d printed mould to create a box out of fiberglass twill weave and epoxy. I used the same method as creating carbon fiber except I used fiberglass which is around 10x cheaper and will help me learn composite making techniques.

Problem: Cyclists require storage on the bike to hold equipment and nutrition.

Solution: Rear Aero Box made from Fiberglass and Carbon Fiber Nylon.

    I will use fiberglass to make the box lightweight yet sturdy

    The shape of the box will be similar to of an airfoil (most aerodynamic shape) to ensure aerodynamic efficiency

    Lid will be magnetically attached so it can be opened one handed


From Sketch to Final Box: 

    Made an initial sketch of the box

    Made a cardboard prototype to test the shape

    3D scanned the mounting area on the bike and made first 3d printed 1st prototype to test fitment

    Made a second prototype to test a hinge and lid

    Made the final version out of fiberglass

Testing #1:

I went on a ride to Cần Giờ with my 3d printed prototype, it worked mostly well but when riding on bricks, the lid sometimes flung up; I will fix this on the final version by using stronger magnets to hold the lid down.

Final Version:

For my final iteration, I made the box smaller and the clamp bigger, then designed a 3d printed mould for the fiberglass.

Manufacturing process: 

    Sanded the 3d printed mould and used filler putty to fill the gaps in between the layer lines

    Used a wet layup approach to lay the fiber glass.

        One side of the mould overlapped the other side such that they would make a strong join. 

    I let it cure under a vacuum for 24 hours to ensure constant compression then split the mold. 

    The outer layer had a very poor surface finish so I applied an additional coat of epoxy 

    Sanded and spray painted to hide imperfections. 

    To attach it to my bike, I drilled holes on the drill press.

Testing #2: For my fiberglass version, I tested it by driving it around Phu My Hung everyday and it worked well.
