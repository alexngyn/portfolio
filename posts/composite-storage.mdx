I designed and made a 3d printed mould to create a box out of fiberglass twill weave and epoxy. I used the same method as creating carbon fiber except I used fiberglass which is around 10x cheaper and will help me learn composite making techniques. I used a wet layup under vacuum, not fun, next time I will just skin a 3d print instead.
