Discover Engineering at USC

Leant New scopes of engineering - 8 fields- 

Aerospace -things in common with mechanical. Build rockets- aerodynamics- use of models to predict. Learning teamwork of 5 . rocket went pretty high. 

Same team for 4 weeks- assigned- fun. 

Life as a college student- living- USc nice, cooked lots, food expensive. Fun. shopping in supermarket. You cooked pasta and bagels 

Transportation- stayed mainly on campus. Trips to amusement parks and beaches. 4th of july, first time fireworks, baseball game, hotdog. 

First unit electrical- learn about logic gates and how they are the fundamental building blocks of computers and how they are wired together

Bartering glue sticks for planks- 1 plank for 5 glue then got back 1 for 1 same team 

Civil- learn trusses and how they distribute the forces within a bridge 
Simulate forces online simulator - issue was bridge roof too low, couldn't get bricks high enough 2nd place. 

Material science- guest speakers-materials they were working on stronger materials 

Aerospace-  different as difficult to test as need to launch- new ways to test- spin with string- parachute 2nd floor 

Chem Sci- not taken yet, interesting- molecules- stable states-explosions stoichiometry

Shifts in mindset? 
Chem is interesting but not sold (too theoretical) - phys science this year with Chem. prefer more hands on or results. 
Assigned an essay weekly- format called ieee used by engineers 
Teamwork- assigned on per person per week 

Interactions with leadership- class size 80 - lectures to start the week off- lots of TAs small group. Main prof didnt interact with much- spent time with prof-prefer small class ratio. Maybe ok for some lectures, careful of all lecture style learning. 

City- LA big city- suburb- didint leave the campus. Like the option of city nearby.
