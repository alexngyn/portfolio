FRC is similar to the VEX Robotics Competition but bigger and better they allow custom parts, giving move freedom of design but adds complexity. 

# RESET 2023

A old coach at my school started a frc team however COVID occured which reduced progress significntly until it was forgoten about. In may 2023, after I came back from vex worlds, me and the new coach decided to restart this project. We relubicated the drivetrain, switched it from two to 4 motor drive for speed, and then got the drivetrain to work. 
The software on the Windows machine was lost, so we had to start from scratch to get a firmware image for the robotRIO and resurrect the FRC robot built by Team 426.

Our school had a art event themed RESET which is named after COVID and we thought showcasing out robot would be apporpriate. 

Driving armchair on the FRC 2020 drivebase for the art show "RESET" on May 25th, 2023.

This project was a huge success. Many people wanted to take a ride on the chair, from young to old. And they enjoyed it!

So much that the two CIM motors actually overheated ðŸ¥µ and reduced their power. We had to make a break to let them cool a little:

# RoboLotus FIRST Robotics 

As we required more funding and members, we decided to start an external club named RoboLotus, which will be the only Vietnamese FRC team for the 2025 Season

I will be Technical Lead Manager for Robolotus FIRST Robotics
